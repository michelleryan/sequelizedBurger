# Eat-Da-Burger

##Overview
Eat-Da-Burger is a single page app which allows the user to input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat and then 'Devour it!'

##Technologies Used
This app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a custom ORM.  It is organized with a MVC design pattern.

##How To Guide
This app is very simple from a user perspective.  On the left side of the page, the current list of burgers already entered into the database are listed with their corresponding "Devour It!" button.  Once the user clicks the button the burger will move from the left side to the right side of the page under the "Devoured Burgers" header.

To create a new burger the user just needs to enter any type of burger they want to create in the "Add a Burger" section located on the bottom center of the page.  Click 'Add Burger' and the new burger will show up in the "Burgers to be Devoured" section.
